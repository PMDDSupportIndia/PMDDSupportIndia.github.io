				<h2>Spread the word. Be the change.</h2>
				<p>Unfortunately, PMDD is at times dismissed as trivial, but can disrupt a woman's life and relationships so completely, she may despair that life itself is not worth living. About 15% of women with PMDD attempt suicide.<br> Fortunately, treatment options exist for PMDD â€” but the most effective are not always prescribed. We aim to bring information related to PMDD to women in need, to anybody who wishes to learn more about this subject. PMDD should not be a shunned and ignored topic but should be discussed, understood and treated for the betterment of women. </p>
