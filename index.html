				<h2>We are here for you</h2>
				<p>Almost 30% women in North India suffer from PMDD. It is more common that we think, and it has a serious effect on lives of menstruating people. We understand, and we care</p>

			<article>
				<h2>What is the purpose of this website?</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this website is to make information about PMDD and its causes, symptoms, diagnosis as well as treatment or support easily accessible to people.There is very limited awareness in our society, due to the fact that any topic related to menstruation is taboo in our society, an attitude that further prevents menstruating people to receive support. <br>We aim to provide support and education on this website so that people can let go of this pervasive taboo.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
				<h2>How do you plan on spreading the word?</h2>
				<p>This online platform has the potential to become a vibrant, thriving online community of peer support as well as easily available resources such as research articles and recent trends, contact information for professionals one can consult, and other small bits of multimedia information that can raise awareness and sensitise people towards PMDD and its consequences. </p>
